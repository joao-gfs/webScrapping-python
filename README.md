# Python Web Scraping
A simple Web Scraping project made on Python.

It accesses the [MetaTFT](https://www.metatft.com/) page using **Selenium** and collects the data from the best comps from Riot Game's Team Fight Tactics game using **BeautifulSoup**. Then the data is registered in a dataframe and converted to an excel file using **Pandas**.

While working on this project I could learn and practice some concepts about HTML, CSS, Python, Python modules, Selenium Framework, pandas DataFrame package and BeautifulSoup package. Besides, I used this project to learn how to use Git and explore its possibilities.
