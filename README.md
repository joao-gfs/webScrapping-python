# Python Web Scraping
A simple Web Scraping project made on Python.

While working on this project I could learn and practice some concepts about HTML, CSS, Python, Python modules, Selenium Framework, pandas DataFrame package and BeautifulSoup package. Besides, I used this project to learn how to use Git and explore its possibilities.
